## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kapify', group: :development
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kapify

## Usage

Require each recipe in `deploy.rb` file.
All recipes could be customized using variables.
Also there are template generators for deep customization.
See README for recipes for details.

Also contains several helpers (some of them are based on Ryan Bate's screencast):

```ruby
as_user
close_session
run_interactively
set_default
template

```

If you want to use these helpers, require `kapify/base` in your `Capfile` or `deploy.rb`
